In vivo 7T MRI dataset probing the auditory system (cortical and subcortical) collected at Maastricht University (Scannexus) by Michelle Moerel, Faruk Gulban, and Federico De Martino. 

All participants have two sessions, in which anatomical MRI (T1w and PDw) and task functional MRI data (8 runs per session) was collected. 

Participants listen to natural sounds (96 sounds) and ripple sounds (4 different sounds, low [300 Hz] or high frequency [4000 Hz]), and perform a noise burst detection task. Noise burst can only occur in the ripple sounds. Per run, noise burst are either more likely to occur in the low (trial_type = ALow) or high frequency ripple sounds (trial_type = AHigh).
